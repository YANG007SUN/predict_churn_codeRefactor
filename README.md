# Predict Customer Churn

## Project Description
In this project, we will identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The Project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

## Project files
`churn_library.py`: python file for creating models<br>
`churn_script_logging_and_tests.py` python file for testing `churn_library.py` file.
